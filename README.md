# My HUGE Version 
Throughout the course of the third year of vocational school, I modified the framework according to the assignments in ITL1/2.
The biggest additions to the framework are the Messenger and Gallery.
But other things have been modified or added as well.

*Beware: the fractals in the previews are due to the compression to gif.*
